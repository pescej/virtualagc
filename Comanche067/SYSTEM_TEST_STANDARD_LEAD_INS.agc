## Filename:	SYSTEM_TEST_STANDARD_LEAD_INS.agc
## Purpose:	Part of the source code for Comanche 67 (Colossus 2C),
##		the one-and-only software release for the Apollo Guidance 
##		Computer (AGC) of Apollo 12's command module.  In the 
##		absence of a contemporary assembly listing for Comanche 67, 
##		the intention is to reconstruct the source code from a 
##		Comanche 55 (Colossus 2A, Apollo 11 CM) baseline and 
##		contemporary documentation describing the differences 
##		between the two.  Page numbers listed in the program 
##		comments follow Comanche 55 unless otherwise noted.
## Assembler:	yaYUL
## Contact:	Ron Burkey <info@sandroid.org>.
## Website:	www.ibiblio.org/apollo.
## Mod history: 2020-12-25 RSB	Began adaptation from Comanche 55 baseline.

# E/BKCALL	FOR DOING BANKCALLS FROM AND RETURNING TO ERASABLE.
#
# THIS ROUTINE IS CALLABLE FROM ERASABLE OR FIXED.  LIKE BANKCALL, HOWEVER, SWITCHING BETWEEN S3 AND S4
# IS NOT POSSIBLE.
#
# THE CALLING SEQUENCE IS:
#
#	TC	BANKCALL
#	CADR	E/BKCALL
#	CADR	ROUTINE		WHERE YOU WANT TO GO IN FIXED.
#	RETURN HERE FROM DISPLAY TERMINATE, BAD STALL OR TC Q.
#	RETURN HERE FROM DISPLAY PROCEED OR GOOD RETURN FROM STALL.
#	RETURN HERE FROM DISPLAY ENTER OR RECYCLE.
#
# THIS ROUTINE REQUIRES TWO ERASABLES (EBUF2, +1) IN UNSWITCHED WHICH ARE UNSHARED BY INTERRUPTS AND
# OTHER EMEMORY PROGRAMS.
#
# A + L ARE PRESERVED THROUGH BANKCALL AND E/BKCALL.

		TC	SWCALL		# GO TO ROUTINE, SETTING Q TO SWRETURN
